# REST API Design Backend Project

This project is a simple REST API design for a backend application using Node.js and Express.js. It is intended to be a starting point for building a full-featured REST API.

## Features

- Basic CRUD operations for a single resource (e.g. users)
- Validation and sanitization of API requests
- Support for JSON and URL-encoded data
- Error handling and logging

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- JSON Schema validation

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
2. Start the server by running `npm run dev`.
3. Use a tool like Postman to test the API endpoints.

## API Endpoints

### Users

- `GET /users`: Retrieve a list of all users.
- `GET /users/:id`: Retrieve a single user by ID.
- `POST /users`: Create a new user.
- `PUT /users/:id`: Update an existing user.
- `DELETE /users/:id`: Delete a user.
